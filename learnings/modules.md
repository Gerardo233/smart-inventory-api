# What's a domain?

In software design, a domain refers to the specific real-world area of knowledge or activity that a program is built to represent and solve problems for.

For example, in an "Inventory Management System", the domain is the management of product stock, purchases, suppliers, and movements.

Inside this domain, we identify several domain entities, such as:

    Product: Represents a physical item stored and tracked in inventory.

    Category: Classifies products into logical groups.

    Supplier: A business or person who provides products.

    User: A system actor that interacts with the inventory (e.g., admins, staff).

    InventoryMovement: Represents a stock input or output event.

These entities are modeled directly in the software using data models and business logic. The combination of all entities and their behaviors defines the domain model.

# What's a module?

A module is a unit logic of code which encapsulates all the logic related to a specific piece of domain (a domain entity)

For example; for the entity of Products I will have the following pieces of code which will be all together a module:

- product.route.ts
- product.services.ts
- product.controller.ts
- product.model.ts
- and more...

# Summary

In a software project, the system itself models a specific real-world domain.
This domain is composed of multiple domain entities (such as Product, User, etc.),
and each entity is developed as a separate module, encapsulating its data model, business logic, and API interface.
